# JlpTest

## Todo:

Dynamic grid view that uses screen dimensions to get displayed columns.

Finish product viewer page, and add compact and non-compact view.

Proper test implementation.

## A few other notes:

Very rudimentary DI usage - should expand and use a framework.

Global scope for coroutines, should create own scope.

Quicktype.io used for generating data classes, remove duplication of certain classes that were generated.

Permissions are basic, and not properly handled.
Proper implementation of flows.

Can’t access JLP Api.

Definitely need to split view models/fragments down the line.

Setup proper nav, at the moment because I am not using a nav controller the back function closed the app!

Cleanup/lint

Loading overlay / splash screen for when inititally loading data.

Can’t parse JLP images to bitmap so need to use placeholder.

Clean up imports.

Non-magic values for padding.

Sort out themes, especially for top bar.

Fine tune colours, find proper font, put colours in proper place.

Sticky bar grid view instead of fixed on page.

Dark mode.

Used a tool to find the font: Gill Sans Greek Pro Greek Medium by Monotype, can’t find free .otf so not going to bother for now.

Setup compose previews.

Proper null handling for data.
